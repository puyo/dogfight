FOREWORD

          Dogfight is a dogfighting game for two to four players, featuring
        different vehicles and backdrops. It was designed with the view that
        a good game is fast, customisable, and more often than not,
        multiplayer. Efforts have been made to include as many options and
        give the player as much freedom as possible. All practical
        suggestions are welcome, and can be sent to gregm@pcug.org.au [1], 
        but please, I am a student and my time is precious.
          Dogfight was created as a year 11 computing assignment for
        Procedual Language Programming 2B at Narrabundah College. Thanks
        go to my teacher Coralie Walker, for allowing me to extend my
        knowledge and experience with C by doing this assignment.

SECTION 2
---------

Player variables

These may be set in the options screens and the configuration file. If they are set in the configuration file, they are not checked before they are used by the game. Although this provides you with more freedom, you *must* know the limits of what may be done.

GENERAL OPTIONS
invincibility_life	how many frames invincibility will last
				(0 <= invincibility_life <= 255)
explosion_speed         time taken for vehicles to explode
                        (will be 8 * explosion_speed) because there are 8
                        frames of animation in an explosion
				(0 <= explosion_speed <= 255)
coralie_mode            set this to true (non-zero) to make the game
                        safe and nice, or false (zero) to leave the
                        violence intact.

LEVEL OPTIONS
gravity			only effects parachutes and splats
				(unsure)
cloud_type*             which 'cloud' graphic to display
				(depends on datafile - see limits.txt)
backdrop*               which backdrop to display
				(depends on datafile - see limits.txt)

VEHICLE OPTIONS
vehicle			which vehicle to use
				(depends on datafile - see limits.txt)
turn_speed              turning speed measured in radians
				(0 <= turn_speed <= pi)
acceleration		vehicle acceleration (added to speed per frame)
				(0 <= acceleration <= 255)
min_speed               vehicle's minimum speed (if negative, vehicle can
                        travel in reverse)
				(unsure)
max_speed               vehicles's maximum speed
                                (0 <= max_speed <= 255)
num_of_shots            number of shots available at any one time (shots
                        are replenished)
				(0 <= num_of_shots <= 255)
shot_life               how many frames a shot will last
				(0 <= shot_life <= 255)
shot_lag                how many frames before another shot can be fired
				(0 <= shot_lag <= 255)
shot_base_speed         added to player's speed to find the actual speed of
                        the shot
				(0 <= shot_base_speed <= 255)
laser_length            the length of laser shots in pixels (only used if a
                        vehicle that uses lasers is being used)
				(0 <= laser_length <= 255)

* These *must* exist in the datafile. If you are unsure, please refer
  to the file limits.txt to see the latest ranges of vehicles, etc


SECTION 3
---------

Other features

These are extra notes on features that may be necessary.


Parachutes
          If you are using bi-planes, and a plane is shot down, a parachute
        will appear. When this is shot down, the player will fall to an
        untimely death on the bottom of the screen.


Coralie Mode
          This is basically the 'nice' mode. If you are upset by the
        over-imaginative graphics when a player hits the ground, press F2
        to turn them off. When your mummy walks out of the room, you can
        turn them back on again with F2.


Lasers
          Lasers can only be used by the appropriate vehicles (rockets, etc).
        Please see "bugs.txt" (the lasers are not finished yet).


The Configuration File
          This should always be kept in the same directory as the executable.
        Although it can be edited, you should take caution. If the
        configuration file is damaged or lost you will need to write a new
        one. If you are unsure of how to do this, contact the author.
          Please note also, that nothing in the configuration file is
        case-sensitive, and no zeros are necessary in decimal-point numbers.
        Any case-formatting is purely intended to make the file easier to
        read and edit.


SECTION 3

Notes

  I have included the source code in case you wish to understand how the
game works. Parts of it are cluttered, parts of it make less sense than
perhaps they should. Much of it could be optimised. But at least it seems
to work :)
  Suggestions on how to improve the code are welcome.

Credits

  Although I, Gregory McIntyre, am the main programmer and this game has
essentially been all my work, these people have often joined in to help
where they could, or otherwise deserve credit.
