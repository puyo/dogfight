  This file is a list of known bugs in Dogfight. If you find a bug that
is not listed here, please email Greg (gregm@pcug.org.au [1]) with a short
description of the problem. He will get around to fixing it eventually.


KNOWN BUGS
----------

*   Vehicles which have negative minimum speeds and positive maximum speeds
  may occasionally not be able to return to rest if the max or min speeds
  are not divisible by the acceleration.

*   Vehicles that pass over the right edge of the screen may suddenly
  appear on the other side, because the coodinate of the plane that is
  checked is the top left corner of the plane, and therefore the last
  thing to go off the screen when the vehicle passes out of the right side.
  The game will reset this x-coodinate to zero, making the plane 'appear'
  on the left.
    What *should* happen is that planes scroll smoothly on and off
  either side.

*   Lasers do not work properly. I am still working on a decent alogarithm
  to check points along a line for collision detection.

*   The screen capture works, but saves more of the screen than there is!
  You will get a larger file that contains static where the screen
  "wasn't".


THINGS WHICH ARE NOT BUGS (but may seem to be... odd)
-----------------------------------------------------

*   If some of the menu options don't seem to work, it is because I have
  not implemented them yet!

*   If a parachute is already plumetting towards the ground and you turn
  Coralie Mode on, there will still be an awful splat - Coralie Mode
  only turns off the parachute collision detection.

*   There is no sound... yet.

*   The range of planes and backgrounds is extremely limited and will be
  much expanded. I mean, face it, it isn't really a choice yet!
