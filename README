= Dogfight, 1997

This was my year 11 computing project at high school. It is a single-screen,
side viewed, bi-plane dogfighting game for 1-4 players (crowding around a
keyboard). It is written in C and uses the Allegro game library.

== Disclaimer

I wrote this program when I was learning the ropes of C. It is ugly and
amatuerish C code, but I don't want to fix it up too much because it has
nostaligic value to me, just the way it is. I chuckle whenever I read
it. It reminds me how far I've come as a programmer.

As of writing, I have fixed the obvious crashing, segfaults or bus errors and
made it run smoothly on a modern computer. However, it would not surprise me if
there were crashes or memory leaks related to sloppy memory and pointer
management.
